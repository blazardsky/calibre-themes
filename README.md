# calibre-themes
Calibre is a great program to read any kind of book you may want to on your desktop. However, I find it's interface quite overcomplicated and the default theme painful sice I'm reading most of the time at night.
For this reason I tried to create a nice theme to use regularly.

I hope this can serve you as well :)


# Installation
I honestly had to spend a few minutes to figure out WHERE THE HELL WAS THAT "settings" icon to change theme. It is on the bottom left, when you open a book.

How to:
--
- Step 1: Open a book
- Step 2: Open settings (a screwdriver and a wrench)
- Step 3: Go to themes and save current theme as "default" (so you can always go back easily)
- Step 4: Go to "user stylesheet" and copy-paste the *blz-d1.css* file
- Repeat Step 3 naming the current style "blz d1 dark theme"

Enjoy.
